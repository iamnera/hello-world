Nera`s repository

Hi all, 

My name is Nera
I am just starting with Computer Science from the absolute 0.
For now I am learning Python, struggling a bit in the amount of information available, trying to keep it simple in order to avoid overwhelming.
I wish you all the best and I hope in the future to be a real part of the GitHub community and to have the skills to contribute as well!
